# Verilog-Labs

## Lab 3:

Lab 3 focuses on sequential logic circuits and memory elements. Students learn about flip-flops, registers, and memory modules through hands-on experience. The lab emphasizes understanding the behavior of these circuits, analyzing clocked sequential circuits, and implementing finite state machines. By utilizing tools like Quartus and ModelSim, students gain practical insights into designing and simulating sequential circuits, enhancing their skills in digital circuitry.

## Lab 4:

Lab 4 delves into the principles of combinational logic and arithmetic circuits. Students explore adders, subtractors, multiplexers, and decoders, gaining a deep understanding of their functionality and applications. Through both theoretical knowledge and practical implementation using Verilog and simulation tools, students grasp essential concepts such as binary arithmetic, Boolean algebra, and data manipulation. The lab equips students with the skills to design intricate combinational circuits, enabling them to solve complex computational problems.

## Lab 6:

Lab 6 explores Finite State Machines (FSMs) and their applications in digital circuit design. The lab is divided into three parts, each focusing on different aspects of FSMs. Part I involves creating a basic FSM recognizing specific input sequences. Part II extends this by implementing an FSM to control a datapath for computations. Part III (optional) challenges students to design a 4-bit restoring divider using an FSM. Students learn to write Verilog code for FSMs, simulate their designs using ModelSim, and synthesize the circuits in Quartus. The lab emphasizes understanding FSM behavior, developing test plans, and integrating control logic with datapaths, enhancing students' skills in complex digital system design.
